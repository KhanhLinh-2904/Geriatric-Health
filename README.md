## Geriatric-Health Promotion and Intelligent Medicine
This project is for midterm test of course "Geriatric Health Promotion and Intelligent Medicine". The aim is to predict ECMO patients about their survival: alive or death as a single target, ignoring brain function. 

This project divides into main stages:
- Preprocess dataset: Analysizing dataset by using bar chart, dealing with the missing value (NaN), classifying the features, and using cross validation to seperate training(80%), validation(10%) and testing(10%) dataset
- Train machine learning methods and deep learning model 
- Compare performance: Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity and AUROC
